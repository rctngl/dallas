# Project Dallas - System Design

## Description

Project Dallas is a constant current electronic load for testing DC power sources in the automotive realm (12-24V) using Mosfets instead of resistive loads.

## Core Requirements

- **Load Voltage:** 12-30V
- **Load Current:** Up to 20A - Asking too much?
- **Load Wattage:** 600W Max (30V 20A)
- **Input Voltage**: ~9V (USB-C)
