# Project Dallas

## Overview

> Project is in EARLY but active development. All hardware and firmware here is not tested yet.

The goal of this project is to apply a reasonably precise load of 0-20A to 20V DC power source. 

### Goals
- Dump 20A of 20V load (Active cooling?)
- Set the target current limit on the fly
- Display target and real current measurments on display
- Be powered with USB-C
- Use standard hardware where possible
- Programmable with Arduino
- Reasonably cost effective

## Development Flow

Each major working build will be created in its own `branch` and then merged into `master` when it becomes the active version.

## Open Source Notes

This is our first open source project and this will be built in the open so please keep that in mind when creating issues or making comments. 

We just want to build cool stuff for everyone to use!
